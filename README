Step 1: Create the torcs directory and clone the repo in the proper location
$ cd /usr/src
$ mkdir torcs
$ cd torcs/
$ mkdir torcs-1.3.7
$ cd torcs-1.3.7/
Clone the git repository here

Step 2: Set up permissions 
$ cd /usr/src/
$ chown -R uname:ugroup torcs
$ cd /usr/local/share/games
$ chown -R uname:ugroup torcs
$ cd /usr/local/lib
$ chown -R uname:ugroup torcs

Step 3: Set up environment variables by adding the following lines to your .bashrc
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib
export TORCS_BASE=/usr/src/torcs/torcs-1.2.4
export MAKE_DEFAULT=$TORCS_BASE/Make-default.mk

Steo 4: Install TORCS
$ cd $TORCS_BASE
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ sudo make datainstall

Important addresses to remember:
/usr/local/share/games/torcs to run TORCS and look up if the installation worked.
$TORCS_BASE/src/drivers/bt to work on the robot.
$TORCS_BASE/export/include/ to search in the header files.

You are all set !

The above set of commands follow Berniw's TORCS robot tutorial

Things to work on:
- Car does not start initially, if human does not start in front of "test". What could possibly be causing that? Change it?
- Change default view settings such that we can always see "test", when competing against others.
- Create a track similar to highway DENSO is driving on.
