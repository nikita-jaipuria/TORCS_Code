Step 1: Create the torcs directory and clone the repo in the proper location
$ cd /usr/src
$ mkdir torcs
$ cd torcs/
$ mkdir torcs-1.3.7
$ cd torcs-1.3.7/
Clone the git repository here

Step 2: Set up permissions 
$ cd /usr/src/
$ chown -R uname:ugroup torcs
$ cd /usr/local/share/games
$ chown -R uname:ugroup torcs
$ cd /usr/local/lib
$ chown -R uname:ugroup torcs

Step 3: Set up environment variables by adding the following lines to your .bashrc
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib
export TORCS_BASE=/usr/src/torcs/torcs-1.2.4
export MAKE_DEFAULT=$TORCS_BASE/Make-default.mk

Step 4: Install TORCS
$ cd $TORCS_BASE
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ sudo make datainstall

Important addresses to remember:
/usr/local/share/games/torcs to run TORCS and look up if the installation worked.
$TORCS_BASE/src/drivers/bt to work on the robot.
$TORCS_BASE/export/include/ to search in the header files.

[The above set of commands follow Berniw's TORCS robot tutorial http://www.berniw.org/tutorials/robot/tutorial.html]

Step 5: Copy paste the chenyi modified_tracks into the /usr/local/share/games/torcs/tracks/road/ folder. This will create several 2-lane and 3-lane tracks.

Notes:
- chenyi_AI2 is obstacle car, does nothing but remain stationary on track
- chenyi_AI3 drives on right-most lane, desired speed of 101kph
- chenyi_AI4 drives on left-most lane, desired speed of 103kph
- chenyi_AI5 drives in center lane, desired speed of 107kph
- chenyi_AI6 drives on right-most lane, desired speed of 103kph
- chenyi_AI7 drives on left-most lane, desired speed of 107kph
- chenyi_AI8 drives in center lane, desired speed of 90kph
- chenyi_AI9 drives on right-most lane, desired speed of 105kph
- chenyi_AI10 drives on left-most lane, desired speed of 105kph
- chenyi_AI11 drives in center lane, desired speed of 105kph
- chenyi_AI12 drives on right-most lane, desired speed of 107kph
- chenyi cars are very basic robots created using the first and a bit of the second chapter of the TORCS robot tutorial

Things to work on:
- Car does not start initially, if human does not start in front of "test". What could possibly be causing that? Change it? --
- Change default view settings such that we can always see "test" or "my car", when competing against others --
- Make the simple chenyi cars drive simply in lanes with highway-like speeds of 105kph/65mph/30mps -- done [few cars get stuck behind each other, in the left-most and right-most track, could be because of the very simple robot structure being used. Important thing is that the cars do not run out of the lanes at such high desired speeds too, if the simple robot structure is followed.]
- Make complicated test car drive in lanes with highway-like speed --
- Create a spectrum of drivers, ranging from very safe to very aggressive driving behavious, by modifying parameters in the existing racing driver codes --
- Create a three-lane and two-lane tracks -- done
- Create four-lane track --
- Create overtaking situations in four-lane track using the freelane (left-most lane) -- 
- Create HSL merging situation in four-lane track -- done
