Step 1: Create the torcs directory and clone the repo in the proper location
$ cd /usr/src
$ mkdir torcs
$ cd torcs/
$ mkdir torcs-1.3.7
$ cd torcs-1.3.7/
Clone the git repository here

Step 2: Set up permissions 
$ cd /usr/src/
$ chown -R uname:ugroup torcs
$ cd /usr/local/share/games
$ chown -R uname:ugroup torcs
$ cd /usr/local/lib
$ chown -R uname:ugroup torcs

Step 3: Set up environment variables by adding the following lines to your .bashrc
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib
export TORCS_BASE=/usr/src/torcs/torcs-1.2.4
export MAKE_DEFAULT=$TORCS_BASE/Make-default.mk

Step 4: Install TORCS
$ cd $TORCS_BASE
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ sudo make datainstall

Important addresses to remember:
/usr/local/share/games/torcs to run TORCS and look up if the installation worked.
$TORCS_BASE/src/drivers/bt to work on the robot.
$TORCS_BASE/export/include/ to search in the header files.

[The above set of commands follow Berniw's TORCS robot tutorial http://www.berniw.org/tutorials/robot/tutorial.html]

Step 5: Copy paste the chenyi modified_tracks into the /usr/local/share/games/torcs/tracks/road/ folder. This will create several 2-lane and 3-lane tracks.

Notes:
- chenyi_AI2 is obstacle car, does nothing but remain stationary on track
- chenyi_AI3 drives on third lane, desired speed of 110kph
- chenyi_AI4 drives on second lane, desired speed of 112kph
- chenyi_AI5 drives in fourth lane, desired speed of 112kph
- chenyi_AI6 drives on third lane, desired speed of 112kph
- chenyi_AI7 drives on second lane, desired speed of 110kph
- chenyi_AI8 drives in first lane, desired speed of 104kph
- chenyi_AI9 drives on fourth lane, desired speed of 114kph
- chenyi_AI10 drives on third lane, desired speed of 114kph
- chenyi_AI11 drives in second lane, desired speed of 114kph
- chenyi_AI12 drives on fourth lane, desired speed of 110kph
- chenyi cars are very basic robots created using the first and a bit of the second chapter of the TORCS robot tutorial
- Ch 1,2,3 are all that are needed for lane-driving, the advanced utilities do not work and are not needed

Things to work on:

- Make the simple chenyi cars drive simply in lanes with highway-like speeds of 105kph/65mph/30mps -- done 
Note: [faster cars tally behind the slower ones, given how desired speeds are set, if not selected in order while configuring race]
- Create a three-lane and two-lane tracks -- done
- Create four-lane track -- done
- Make chenyi cars drive in lanes in the four-lane track -- done 
- Define rules for lane change and lane keep based on desired speed --
- Create a spectrum of drivers, ranging from very safe to very aggressive driving behavious, by modifying parameters in the existing racing driver codes --
- Create overtaking situations in four-lane track using the freelane (left-most lane) -- 
- Create HSL merging situation in four-lane track -- 
- Car does not start initially, if human does not start in front of "test". What could possibly be causing that? Change it? --
- Change default view settings such that we can always see "test" or "my car", when competing against others --
